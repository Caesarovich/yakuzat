NodeJS Discord/Twitch Bot for the Yakuza Family


This was done using [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/) and [TMIJS](https://tmijs.com/).

I just wanted to share this Bot on Github for no other reason than making the code open-source.


## Twitch To Discord Chat Relay Bot

This bot features a Twitch to Discord chat relay.
You can use it as an example if you're trying to achieve this.
Soon I'll try to make a repository explaining how this works.
